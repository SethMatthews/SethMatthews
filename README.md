### Hi there, I am Seth ðŸ‘‹

I am a Mathematics and Computer Science graduate and the creator of seekmysalary.com

I am passionate about web development and like to learn everything I can about everything modern full-stack applications, including frontend, backend, and infrastructure (AWS). I enjoy coding in the following languages Python, Javascript, Typescript, HTML, and CSS and have strong knowledge of AWS, cloud-native architectures, and RESTful APIs.

My next goal is to learn, React, Node, TailwindCSS, and AWS SDK (Typescript) as I love the idea of being able to build a full-stack application in only Typescript.

If you are looking to hire a graduate web developer based in Melbourne CBD please feel free to contact me.
